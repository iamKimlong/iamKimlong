🌱 I’m currently majoring in Cybersecurity and building hands-on experience alongside my studies through Hack The Box labs and CTF competitions such as PicoCTF and other security challenges.

🔭 Outside of coursework, I work on personal projects centered around scripting and automation, mainly using Lua, Python, Bash, and Rust.
